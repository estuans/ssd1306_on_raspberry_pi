Automatic system service to display stats on an SSD1306 OLED display on a Raspberry Pi 4

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This is code I found on the internet and modified to automatically configure an SSD1306 OLED display to show IP address, CPU load, CPU temperature, disk space, and available memory.  

You can try running the setup.sh script to automatically setup the system, but I'd recommend looking at that file and manually doing the steps that you need to.  

Enjoy.
